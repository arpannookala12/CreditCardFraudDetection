## üéØ Overview

Credit card fraud detection is crucial for financial institutions to protect customers from unauthorized transactions. This project implements a robust machine learning pipeline that:

- Handles highly imbalanced datasets (0.172% fraud cases)
- Uses advanced feature engineering techniques
- Implements SMOTE for synthetic minority oversampling
- Applies Weight of Evidence (WOE) transformation
- Provides risk scoring from 0-100 with categorized risk levels

**Key Quote**: *"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see."* - John W. Tukey

## üìä Dataset Description

The dataset comprises credit card transactions over a **two-day period in September 2013** with the following characteristics:

- **Total Transactions**: 284,807
- **Fraud Cases**: 492 (0.172% of total)
- **Features**: 30 total
  - `V1-V28`: PCA-transformed features (confidential)
  - `Time`: Elapsed seconds since first transaction
  - `Amount`: Transaction amount
  - `Class`: Target variable (0 = Non-fraud, 1 = Fraud)

### Dataset Highlights
- **Average Transaction Amount**: ~$66 USD
- **No Missing Values**: Clean dataset requiring no imputation
- **Highly Imbalanced**: 99.83% non-fraud vs 0.17% fraud transactions

## ‚ú® Key Features

### 1. **Advanced Data Preprocessing**
- **SMOTE Implementation**: Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique
  - Increased fraud cases from 469 to 65,598
  - Balanced dataset for improved model training

### 2. **Feature Engineering**
- **Weight of Evidence (WOE)** transformation
- **Information Value (IV)** calculation for feature selection
- **Optimal Binning** algorithms for continuous variables

### 3. **Risk Scoring System**
- Fraud scores normalized to 0-100 range
- Risk categorization:
  - **No Risk** (0-25)
  - **Low Risk** (25-50)
  - **Moderate Risk** (50-75)
  - **High Risk** (75-100)

## üî¨ Methodology

### 1. Data Preprocessing
```python
# SMOTE Implementation
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE
smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=0.3)
X_res, y_res = smote.fit_resample(X, y)
```

### 2. Feature Engineering Pipeline
- **Binning**: Continuous variables split into optimal bins
- **WOE Calculation**: `WOE = ln(% of non-events / % of events)`
- **Information Value**: `IV = Œ£(% of non-events - % of events) * WOE`

### 3. Feature Selection Criteria
- **IV > 0.3**: Strong relationship to fraud detection
- **IV 0.1-0.3**: Medium strength relationship
- **IV < 0.1**: Weak or no relationship

### 4. Model Training
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Input**: WOE-transformed features
- **Output**: Probability scores converted to risk categories

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
Python 3.7+
```

### Required Libraries
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn imbalanced-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

## üíª Usage

### Basic Implementation
```python
# Load and preprocess data
from fraud_detection import FraudDetector

# Initialize detector
detector = FraudDetector()

# Load dataset
data = detector.load_data('creditcard.csv')

# Apply SMOTE
X_balanced, y_balanced = detector.apply_smote(data)

# Feature engineering
X_transformed = detector.woe_transform(X_balanced)

# Train model
model = detector.train_model(X_transformed, y_balanced)

# Generate predictions
predictions = detector.predict(X_test)
risk_scores = detector.calculate_risk_scores(predictions)
```

### Risk Score Calculation
```python
# Calculate fraud scores
coefficients = model.coef_
log_odds = np.dot(X_test_trans, coefficients.T)
offset = 600
factor = 50
fraud_scores = offset + factor * log_odds

# Normalize to 0-100 range
normalized_scores = np.clip(fraud_scores, 0, 100)
```
